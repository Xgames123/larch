# 1d3f architectures (larch)
My attempts at making 'cpu architectures'

## mcc (MineCraft Computer)
These are designed to run in Minecraft (have never been built)

### Docs
* [mccv2](docs/v2.md)
* [mccv1](docs/v1.md) (has some design problems)

### Assembling
A assembler for mccv2 can be found [here](tools/mccasm)
* For Linux run the install.sh script to install

#### Programs
Some programs written in assembly can be found [here](programs/)
> **NOTE**
> Some don't work
