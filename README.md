# 1d3f architectures (larch)
My attempts at making 'cpu architectures'

## nna (No Name Architecture)
4 bit general purpose architecture.
- [nna1](nna/spec/nna1.md)

## mcc (MineCraft Computer)
These are designed to run in Minecraft (have never been built)
- [mccv3](docs/v3/core.md) (technicaly works but requires gigabrain to write anything useful)
- [mccv2](docs/v2.md) (has some design problems)
- [mccv1](docs/v1.md) (has some design problems)
